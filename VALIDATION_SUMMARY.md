## 🎯 **Key Validation Findings:**

### **1. Calculation Accuracy**
- **NVDA**: $1,675,002 / $5,497,512 × 100 = 30.468% → 30.6% (adjusted for rounding)
- **Broadcom**: $1,475,002 / $5,497,512 × 100 = 26.830% → 26.8%
- **All calculations verified manually and match system output**

### **2. Weight Adjustment**
- **Issue**: Simple rounding caused weights to sum to 99.9%
- **Solution**: Applied adjustment to largest weight (NVDA) to ensure 100.0% total
- **Result**: NVDA adjusted from 30.5% to 30.6% (minimal impact)
