# Congress Buys Equity Index - Final Results

## Index Methodology

The Congress Buys Equity Index follows QuiverQuant's methodology:

1. **Data Window**: All STOCK-Act purchase disclosures (House + Senate, including spouses/dependents) from the last 100 calendar days, excluding sales and short positions.
2. **Dollar Sizing**: Convert reported dollar ranges to midpoints and sum all buys by ticker.
3. **Constituent Selection**: Rank tickers by total dollars purchased and select top 10.
4. **Weighting Rule**: Weight each stock pro-rata to its share of total dollars purchased.
5. **Output**: Table with ticker, company name, and index weight (rounded to 1 decimal place).
